title: Custom JSON Properties
---

If your property editor stores its values within a JSON object, you can use the config
file to tell Translation Manager how to interpret your properties data.
For example, if you have a property that stores its data in the following format:

```json
{
    "Key", "some-key-value",
    "Title", "my property title",
    "Content", "<p>some rich text content</p>"
}
```
Then you could use the config options below to define the Title and Content
fields as text-based.
Within the *Mappers* section of the config file, you can define this using the `<custom>`
or `<grid>` config nodes (see below for details of how the grid naming works).

```xml
<mappers>
    <custom>
        <config alias="My.Custom.Property">
            <properties>
                <property name="Title" alias="Umbraco.Textbox" />
                <property name="Content" alias="Umbraco.TinyMCEv3" />
            </properties>
        </config>
    </custom>
</mappers>
```
This config tells Translation Manager to treat all My.Custom.Property values as
JSON and to extract the title and content values when creating and importing
translations.
