title: Approve Translations
---

When a job has been received from your translators it will progress into the "Received" area. 

At this point you can check the content to see what has been returned, editing or removing translations as required.

## Approving Content 

If you are happy with the returned content you can approve the [translation job](../reference/fundementals/job) and return the content to your site. 

The approve button has five options.
