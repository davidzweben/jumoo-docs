title: LanguageWire Connector
---

The LanguageWire connector allows you to connect your Umbraco installation to the [LanguageWire](https://www.languagewire.com/) translation platform.

## Install the LanguageWire Connector 

The LanguageWire connector has been written for Translation Manager v9 and v10. This connector will work on Umbraco 8, Umbraco 9, and Umbraco 10.

You can install the connector via the command line: 

```cli
dotnet add package Jumoo.TranslationManager.LanguageWire
```

or nuget package manager:

```cls
install-package Jumoo.TranslationManager.LanguageWire
```

## Settings

Once you enter your licence key, for which you should consult your LanguageWire project manager, you will be able to see the Languagewire connector settings page.

Account, Terminologies, Products and Work Areas are defined by LanguageWire based on your needs

Locking an option will mean that an editor will now be allowed to choose an option when they send content to translation.

### Language Mappings

You should consult with your LanguageWire project manager on HTML configuration and language mappings as these can be used to tweak how information is sent to Languagewire.
