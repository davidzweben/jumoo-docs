title: Translation Connectors
---


A translation connector takes the [Translation Job](../../reference/fundementals/job) and puts it into the required format for a translator or translation service to perform the translation.

> e.g The XLIFF connector takes a translation job and turns it into an XLIFF file. You can then send it to a translator, who will fill in the translations and send the file back. The connector then puts the translated values back into the translation job for Translation Manager to process.

There are a number of connectors available for translation services, you can view our current list of connectors at : https://jumoo.co.uk/translate/providers/
